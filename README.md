# Countdown timer - Week #2

[![Workflow result](https://github.com/opatry/android-dev-challenge-compose-week2/workflows/Check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/opatry/android-dev-challenge-compose-week2/actions/workflows/Check.yaml)

## :scroll: Description

This app lists timers to launch at will for different needs.
Each unit has its own indicator (for hours, minutes and seconds).

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

The main idea was to bring a really visual way to represent time, using distinct progress for each units with its own nested color circles.
It was tough to deal with time arithmetic and smooth animation each seconds.

I'm kind of satisfied by final visual even if not perfect.
I learn a lot with this challenge #2 (Animation, backdrop (incl. conceal/reveal using `rememberCoroutineScope`), time arithmetic, canvas composable, custom font, `LazyColumn.stickyHeader`).
